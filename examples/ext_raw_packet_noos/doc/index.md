# Extension: Packet Tx/Rx (NoOS)

This example use "extension" bundle to transmit/receive raw packets without any RTOS.

This example is the same as [_Extension: Packet Tx/Rx_](../../ext_raw_packet/doc/index.md), except
that in this example no RTOS is used. See also [_Peripheral Console (Realtime)_](../../peripheral_console_realtime/doc/index.md)
which runs the whole BLE stack without RTOS.

This example also demonstrates the usage of `platform_set_timer`.
