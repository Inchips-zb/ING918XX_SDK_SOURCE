# Peripheral Console

This example demonstrates how to:

* Design something like serial port in BLE;
* Power saving;
* Detect `EXT_INT` key events in power saving;
* Over-the-air debugging;
* RF power mapping.

Note: 
    1. '\0' masks the end of a string;
    1. Connect `EXT_INT` key to both `EXT_INT` and `KEY_PIN`.
